#INTRO

my name is Aidan and i've put a little too much time into this lab for my Web Applications course.
this readme is basically just for troubleshooting options and some warnings.
i may add more categories to this file at some point.

#WARNINGS

these oauth methods were made using apps registered by me on each of the platforms.
to fix this, you must go register your own apps on each platform, and get your own client id and secret. please.
